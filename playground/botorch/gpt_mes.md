Sure, I'd be happy to derive the Max Entropy Search (MES) acquisition function for you and explain the steps involved.

The MES acquisition function is a method used in Bayesian optimization to determine the next point to sample in a black-box optimization problem. It works by maximizing the expected entropy of the posterior distribution over the objective function, with the goal of maximizing the uncertainty about the optimal value of the objective function. This helps to balance exploration and exploitation, allowing the optimization algorithm to find a good balance between exploring different regions of the search space and exploiting the current knowledge about the objective function to find the best possible solution.

The general form of the MES acquisition function is given by:

$$a_{MES}(x) = -\mathbb{E}_{f \sim p(f | D)} [H(f)]$$

where $a_{MES}(x)$ is the MES acquisition value at a point $x$, $p(f | D)$ is the posterior distribution over the objective function $f$ given the current data $D$, and $H(f)$ is the entropy of the distribution $f$.

To derive the MES acquisition function, we can start by expressing the entropy of a distribution $f$ as:

$$H(f) = -\int p(f) \log p(f) df$$

where $p(f)$ is the probability density function (PDF) of the distribution $f$.

Next, we can substitute the posterior distribution $p(f | D)$ for the distribution $f$ in the above expression to obtain:

$$H(f | D) = -\int p(f | D) \log p(f | D) df$$

This expression represents the entropy of the posterior distribution $p(f | D)$, which is a measure of uncertainty about the optimal value of the objective function $f$.

Finally, we can take the expectation of the entropy of the posterior distribution with respect to the posterior distribution itself to obtain the expected entropy of the posterior distribution, which is the quantity that is maximized by the MES acquisition function:

$$\mathbb{E}_{f \sim p(f | D)} [H(f | D)] = -\int p(f | D) H(f | D) df$$

Substituting the expression for the entropy of the posterior distribution from above, we obtain:

$$\mathbb{E}_{f \sim p(f | D)} [H(f | D)] = -\int p(f | D) \left( -\int p(f | D) \log p(f | D) df \right) df$$

This expression represents the expected entropy of the posterior distribution over the objective function $f$, which is the quantity that is maximized by the MES acquisition function. To obtain the final form of the MES acquisition function, we simply need to negate this expression, which gives us:

$$a_{MES}(x) = \int p(f | D) \left( \int p(f | D) \log p(f | D) df \right) df$$

This is the general form of the MES acquisition function, which can be used to determine the next point to sample in a black-box optimization problem by maximizing the expected entropy of the posterior distribution over the objective function.
